 FRENCH_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The French are triumphant! After the victory at Sedan, and in the Great War, the French Empire is the dominant global power, rivaled only by the sleeping giant in the west. However, we must reorganize our new empire, lest it fall into disarray."
 PRU_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Even with Bismarck's brilliant political maneuvering for the decades leading up to the war against France, the 'Army with a State' still lost. All of his progress was reversed, and Prussia was stripped of the valuable Rhineland. With radical ideologies gathering steam in Prussia, the stage is set for a new attempt at uniting Germany once and for all, peacefully or not."
 UK_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Monarchy is gone! After centuries of oppression under the capitalist system, the British Peoples now are united in labor. That being said, the monarchy still lives, being exiled to their Indian and Oceanian Empire. And regardless of that, the Union needs to undergo some changes, and needs to decide whether to fully integrate the Scots and the Irish, and how the revolution is to be spread. Only time will tell what the Union will do."
 JAPAN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Japan has survived the Western scourge unscathed. While other Asian states failed to stand up against the imperialist powers, Japan thrived, and became an imperialist power itself, conquering Korea, and various Pacific Islands. Now Japan must make a decision. With the American giant asleep, and the French too overextended to wage war with Japan, opportunity abounds for further conquests in the mainland, with many strategists eyeballing China as the next target."
 RUS_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Russia has been beaten, humiliated, and weakened. War after war Russia has suffered defeat after defeat. The Tsar's prestige is at an all time low. Much of his powers have been ceded to a legislative assembly, and the Reds seem to be building up for another Revolution. The military is in shambles and the economy is broken. Will Russia bounce back, as it always has? Or will Russia collapse into anarchy and disorder?"
 SAR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Italian Unification will happen. It is only a matter of when and how. With the recent rise in Neo-Latinist ideology, talk has begun over not just uniting Italy, but reforming the Roman Empire. Sardinia is in the best position to achieve these things, out of all the Italian States, and with the collapse of Austria-Hungary, and with France focusing on other things, now might just be the time to do it."
 SPA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Spain's Empire has been reduced to nearly nothing. After the Spanish American War, Spain had been stripped of most of its colonies, having only minor holdings in Africa to boast of. After a Civil War that overthrew the Monarchy, Spain is in a state of transition. Will it embrace leftist ideology, or will it seek power in the right? Or, will France, or other powers, seek to establish their own will in Spain?"
 US_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The United States has established itself as the dominant power in the Americas. However, not many of the American nations appreciate this influence. With the occupation of Haiti and the Dominican Republic in '32, and the establishment of various puppet regimes in Central America, there is widespread discontent, in these nations and in America itself. With the '36 election on the horizon, set to be the most influential election of American history, America is at a crossroads."

 POR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Portugal has remained a junior partner in European politics for centuries, often relying on larger powers such as Britain or Spain to act before it will. After losing it's colony in Brazil, Portugal was further downgraded in the political playing field. Britain collapsed to the communists and Spain's government fell to a military junta, leaving Portugal isolated. Following an assassination of the ruling king, Manuel II, chaos erupted in the countryside, resulting in the military takeover of the state, lead by Francisco Craviero Lopes. While the Monarchy and it's consititution is still legally in effect, many have quickly grown tired of the military occupation, and the clock is ticking."
 HUN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Independence came at a heavy cost for the Hungarian people; following the collapse of the Austrian dominated dual monarchy, war and bloodshed was a common occurence for years to come, as conflict spread like wildfire. Poles, Romanians, Serbs, Croats and even the Austrians made war with the new Hungarian state, wishing to rip it apart piece by piece, but despite losing territory, Hungary has carried on. Marxists eventually forced the government into exile, declaring a People's Republic. This was, however, soon overthrown, and order was moreorless restored. Ethnic conflict, conflicting military interests, and political discourse only push the nation closer to the edge of catastrophe."
 AUS_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Austria has seen a drop in power and influence unheard of in centuries, torn apart with internal conflict, leaving only the most ethnically German territories under the yellow and black banner. Hungary established itself as a central european power, Croatia quickly dominated the Western Balkans, and the furthest territories fell to Poland, Prussia, Romania and Serbia. The Archduchy is on the knife's edge, and must act soon, or fall further into disunity."
 OTT_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Ottoman Empire has been on a quick decline for a long time, losing all of it's Balkan territories excluding the now autonomous Constantinople. The Russians, Greeks, Egyptians and more look upon the aging empire with hungry eyes, threatening the further existence of the Ottomans as a state and a people. There is much to be done to preserve what there is left, and little time to do it."
 MAN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The last century has not been kind to the Manchu dynasty of Qing, with the loss of more and more lands to Europeans and internal conflict after conflict, resulting in the eventual collapse of the great Qing state. Now, the Emperor lives in the last outhold in Manchuria, with the remnants of Qing loyalists occupy Manchuria and Inner Mongolia. Japan, Russia and the newly formed Republic of China all appear ready to pounce at the right moment. Careful planning will save us, nothing more, nothing less."
 CHINA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The fall from grace was hard for the Qing, but ultimately a victory for the Han people of China. At last, freedom had been gained from the tyrrany the foreign Emperors! Now, the matters of state must consume the minds of the fledgling Republic. Many of the former Chinese lands are held by various states and peoples, including the ever aggressive European nations. We must strive to bring about a new chinese state, lest we lose everything."
 IND_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The British Raj, once a jewel in the belt of the massive British Empire, has become the home of the British royal family and government in exile, following the British Civil War, which established a People's Republic in the mainland. The majority non-christian population of the land is at best disgruntled with the governmental authority over their land, but they continue on. The government wishes to return home to Britian proper, however, along side the former British territories."
